## My process

For me this was a task to see what I could create in a little over an hour.  I didn't want to spend too much time, just have a quick, stimulating project and practice old fashioned HTML and CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a great exercise in practicing flex! It is always an interesting process seeing where it needs to be placed in order to get the desired result.  This was also good practice for HTML, playing around with the elements and seeing how I should organize them so that when I go to style, things will fall into place.
